# WhatsApp Translator

Small WhatsApp Web client with a local web UI, message history, translation, AI replies, and MCP access.

## Deploy

Railway is the easiest hosted option for this app because it supports long-running services and a persistent volume for WhatsApp session data.

## Features

Incoming messages send WhatsApp read receipts only after they remain visible for 0.7 seconds in the active app or browser tab. This applies to conversations, combined Messages, and the selected full-screen media item. Loading, syncing, translating, and offscreen messages do not send receipts. Viewed IDs are queued offline and retried after reconnecting; group receipts preserve the original sender, and WhatsApp read-receipt privacy settings still apply.

Text AI defaults to GPT-6 Astra with low reasoning. The shared OpenAI settings override environment model choices; selecting Astra with no reasoning selection uses low. Speech recognition and speech synthesis retain their dedicated audio models.

Native **Settings → Appearance → App icon** offers ten original image-generated designs, alongside the existing icon: Paper Bridge, Neon Orbit, Sunrise, Porcelain, Botanical, Pixel Passport, Ribbon, Monochrome, Mosaic, and Cosmic Whale. iPhone and iPad use the selected Home Screen icon; macOS remembers a local Dock icon choice and reapplies it while the app runs, leaving the signed app and Finder icon unchanged. Select **Original** to reset. No server connection is needed to choose an icon.

Enable **Conversation settings → Reply only** for any person or group to prevent unprompted sends. Choose an incoming message and tap **Reply** before sending text, photos, files, videos or voice notes. The choice is saved on the server and applies across iOS/iPadOS, macOS, web and connected tools. Combined **Messages** requires an explicit reply selection; replying to the latest message still includes its quote. Your own, deleted or another conversation’s messages cannot unlock sending. Turn the setting off to resume normal sending. Reactions remain available.

Translation defaults **off for every person and group**, including existing conversations. Open **Conversation settings → Translate messages** to enable it for a particular chat. The server saves the choice by conversation ID and shares it across web, iOS/iPadOS, macOS, and unified **Messages**. In Messages, long-press or right-click a message's conversation heading to open those same settings. Disabled conversations send text and captions as written and voice notes as original recordings, without language detection or other translation AI calls. Disabling also cancels queued incoming translations and releases pending notifications; saved language, style, and original-follow-up preferences are retained.

For enabled conversations, incoming text and media captions translate into `WA_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE`. Outgoing text, captions, and voice use a conversation override first, then the replied-to incoming message's language, then the predominant recent incoming language. Unknown chat language is resolved from recent incoming text before sending. Language-neutral messages stay unchanged. Translation failures prevent outgoing sends and incoming jobs retry with backoff; opening an enabled conversation queues previously undetected text and captions.

Open **Topics** in a conversation or the native unified **Messages** feed to enable automatic organisation for individual chats. Topic classification uses the existing OpenAI key and shared model settings, independently of translation. It starts with the latest 200 text messages and captions, then processes new messages and edits in background batches. Topic labels appear in the configured default language; matching labels from different people and groups combine into one category in Messages. Each message retains its source chat; a topic selected inside a conversation still shows only that conversation. The AI prefers broad categories of 1–3 words, such as Hospital, Shopping, Photos and Birthday wishes. Hospital support, delays, surgery and recovery belong under Hospital. Existing detailed labels are simplified in a bounded background pass using only their titles; messages stay visible in their current categories until each validated merge completes. Categories are reused across chats when the subject fits. **All messages** always restores the full timeline, and replies and reactions still address the original WhatsApp message. Incoming replies retain WhatsApp’s embedded original quote even when its message is absent from loaded history. A later history sync can restore quotes previously dropped by older builds; originals that WhatsApp does not resend cannot be reconstructed from the stored text alone. Classifications are stored on the server, survive restarts, and refresh across clients. Disabling topics stops new classification and hides that chat's topic views while retaining saved assignments. Failed batches retry up to three times; re-enabling or choosing retry starts another attempt. Enabling topics adds AI usage and does not alter anyone else's WhatsApp interface.

For an initial import, choose **Topics → Organise last 7 days from all chats**. The app previews the number of unorganised text messages and captions before you start. It uses only messages already stored on the server, excludes Updates and older history, skips existing topic assignments, and enables ongoing organisation for the included chats. Classification runs in background batches and the Topics panel shows progress; repeating the import safely skips completed messages.

Required for native iOS push notifications:

- `APNS_KEY_ID` Apple push notification key ID
- `APNS_TEAM_ID` Apple Developer team ID
- `APNS_BUNDLE_ID` iOS app bundle identifier
- `APNS_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64` base64-encoded contents of the APNs `.p8` private key

The APNs key is a production secret. Keep the downloaded `.p8` file outside the
repository and provide it to the deployed service only through secret environment
variables. The authenticated `POST /api/push/test` endpoint sends a test alert to
all currently registered iPhones.

Hosted deploy recommendation:

- `WA_PASSWORD` is required on non-loopback hosts; startup fails without it
- attach a persistent volume at `/data`
- if `WA_PORT` is not set, the app will use Railway's `PORT`
- MCP OAuth supports explicitly approved local clients and ChatGPT. Dynamic client
  registration accepts loopback HTTP/HTTPS callbacks and the documented HTTPS
  callbacks on `chatgpt.com`: `/connector/oauth/{callback_id}` and the legacy
  `/connector_platform_oauth_redirect`. Other remote hosts, callback paths,
  credentials, nonstandard ports, queries and fragments are rejected. Authorization
  still requires an exact registered redirect match, password approval and S256 PKCE.

## Pasting images

Copy an image, then use **Paste** in the message box on iPhone or iPad, or **⌘V** on Mac. Pasted images open the photo preview, where you can add a caption, cancel, or send. Multiple copied images (up to 30) and image files copied in Finder are supported. Your existing text draft is preserved, and ordinary text paste still works. This is available in both individual chats and the unified Messages view.

## Chat gallery

On iPhone, iPad, and Mac, open a conversation and choose **Gallery** in the header. Photos and videos appear newest first in a square grid grouped by date, including older media saved on the server. Open any item full screen, then swipe left or right (or use the arrow buttons) to move between photos and videos. Photos support zooming; videos play in place and pause when you move away. Older items load as you browse. Deleted messages, stickers, audio, and documents are excluded.

## WhatsApp reconnection

Temporary connection drops reconnect using the saved WhatsApp session. If WhatsApp removes the linked device, the backend restarts linking automatically and the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and web apps display a fresh QR code. Expired codes are replaced automatically; successful linking returns to the inbox. Saved chats and server credentials are retained. The native apps also check status on returning to the foreground and periodically while open, so a missed live event does not leave the app stuck.

To scan the code, use WhatsApp on the account's main phone under **Settings → Linked Devices → Link a Device**. When using Babel Bridge on that same phone, display the code on a computer or tablet.

## Device-address repair

Private chats use the WhatsApp account address. Device suffixes such as `:17`
and `:22` are removed after WhatsApp resolves an LID to a phone address; an
unresolved LID stays in its own namespace. The same rule applies to history
imports, cached conversation links, replies and saved voice preparations.

On first startup after this update, the server repairs older split conversations
in one SQLite transaction. It preserves message IDs, contents, timestamps,
attachments, unread totals and the existing account conversation's preferences.
Before merging, it saves a private, consistent `messages-before-device-jid-repair-*.db`
snapshot beside `messages.db`, using SQLite's page backup API with a 4 MiB
destination cache. Copy progress is logged every five seconds; interrupted starts
reuse only the incomplete destination, while completed snapshots are retained.
Keep completed snapshots for recovery and provide space for another copy of the
database. Railway allows up to ten minutes for this one-time startup work. A failed
snapshot or merge stops startup without applying a partial repair. Successful startup logs the repaired conversation and
message counts without logging phone numbers or message contents.

## Run Locally

Prerequisites:

- Rust
- Go
- FFmpeg (required for voice-note conversion, gallery previews, and media integration tests; included in Docker)

Run:

```bash
export WA_WEB=true
export WA_HOST=127.0.0.1
export WA_ALLOW_LOCAL_NO_AUTH=true
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here

cargo run --release
```

Notes:

- If `go` is installed, `cargo` will try to build `wa-bridge` automatically.
- If not, build it manually:

```bash
cd wa-bridge
go build -o wa-bridge .
cd ..

export WA_WEB=true
export WA_HOST=127.0.0.1
export WA_ALLOW_LOCAL_NO_AUTH=true
export WA_BRIDGE_PATH="$PWD/wa-bridge/wa-bridge"
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here

cargo run --release
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

The supported backend is the Rust app (`cargo run --release`). The `web/`
package is only for frontend tests and Storybook previews; it does not run a
separate Node API server.

## Translated voice notes

In conversations with **Translate messages** enabled, incoming voice notes are transcribed, translated into your default language, and
spoken by an AI-generated voice. The original remains available beside the
translation. Older recordings can be translated on demand.

Use the microphone button in a conversation to record up to three minutes,
listen to the translated preview, then send it as a WhatsApp voice note. Set the
conversation language first if it has not yet been detected. The existing
original-follow-up setting also applies to recordings. Translation failures do
not send the original as a fallback. Prepared recordings expire after 15 minutes;
if a send reports an uncertain delivery, check the conversation before recording
and sending again.

Choose Automatic, Masculine, Feminine, or Neutral in app settings for your
outgoing voice, or conversation settings for a contact's translated voice.
Automatic approximately matches acoustic pitch and falls back to Neutral when
uncertain; it does not clone the speaker or identify their gender. Each choice
has an audible sample. Changing a setting applies to the next prepared recording.

Original recording preparation requires microphone permission and FFmpeg. With translation off, recordings are not sent to OpenAI. Translated voice processing additionally requires an OpenAI key with
access to `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe` and `gpt-4o-mini-tts`. Browser recording requires
HTTPS or localhost. Audio and transcripts are sent to OpenAI for processing;
cached recordings are stored in the private application database. Audio-service
charges are not currently included in the app's text-model usage totals.

## MCP access

The Streamable HTTP endpoint is `/mcp`. OAuth permissions are split into:

- `whatsapp.read` — status, conversation discovery, message history/search,
  and message preparation
- `whatsapp.send` — sending prepared messages and replies, reactions, and read
  receipts; this scope requires `whatsapp.read`

If an authorization request omits scope, it receives read-only access. A DCR
registration that omits scope is eligible to request both supported scopes later;
registration itself grants no access. Explicit read-only registrations remain
restricted to read-only authorization. Password consent, PKCE and exact registered
redirect matching are required before any tokens are issued. The legacy `mcp`
scope retains its existing behavior for previously registered clients.

If ChatGPT reports "Requested scope is not registered for this OAuth client",
its existing registration does not permit the requested send scope. Read-only
connection remains possible by selecting only `whatsapp.read`. For send access,
recreate the DCR connection after the corrected server release so registration can
include both supported scopes. Reauthorization alone does not update existing
registration metadata, and this release does not migrate clients or token grants.

The read workflow exposes `get_status`, `list_contacts`, `search_contacts`,
`read_messages`, `search_messages`, and `prepare_message`. External writes are
separate: `send_message`, `reply_to_message`, `react_to_message`, and
`mark_conversation_read`.

Text sends are deliberately two-step:

1. Call `prepare_message` to resolve the exact recipient, translation mode,
   target language, final text, and optional reply target.
2. Show that result to the user, then pass its short-lived preparation token
   and a unique idempotency key to `send_message` or `reply_to_message`.

When a conversation requires translation, preparation fails closed if the
translator is unavailable, errors, or returns empty text. The English source is
never sent as a fallback. Use `translation_mode: "never"` only when sending the
provided text unchanged is intentional.

## Deploy on Railway

1. Click the Railway button above.
2. Attach a persistent volume mounted at `/data`.
3. Set:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` if you want AI features
   - `WA_PASSWORD` (required)
4. Deploy and open the generated Railway domain.

The repo includes [railway.toml](/Users/vultuk/Development/Personal/whatsapp-translator/railway.toml) for Dockerfile-based deploys and unauthenticated `/api/health` health checks.

## Run With Docker

Build:

```bash
docker build -t whatsapp-translator .
```

Run:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v whatsapp-translator-data:/data \
  -e WA_WEB=true \
  -e WA_PASSWORD=choose_a_strong_password \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here \
  whatsapp-translator
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

## Data

The app stores local state in the data directory, including:

- `session.db` for WhatsApp session state
- `messages.db` for chats, settings, and usage
- OAuth client registrations and bearer/refresh tokens for approved MCP clients

Treat the data directory as secret material. OAuth tokens in `messages.db` are
bearer credentials for local MCP clients; protect the volume, set `WA_PASSWORD`
on reachable deployments, and use logout or the protected OAuth client revocation
API to revoke access. Do not commit those files or any `.env` file with real
secrets.

## Delivery and connection recovery

Incoming text is stored immediately. In enabled conversations it is then translated by two background workers.
The persistent queue holds up to 1,000 pending jobs and retries failed jobs up to
three attempts. Queue overflow and exhausted retries retain the original message;
manual translation remains available. Completed translations update the existing
message without creating another unread message.

WhatsApp edits replace the original message in both conversation and unified-feed
views, preserving its send time, reactions, and attachments. The latest edit is
persisted even when it arrives before its target during history recovery. Edits
clear outdated translations and queue the corrected text in enabled conversations;
late translation results and older message snapshots cannot undo a newer edit.
Native and web messages show an Edited label beside the original send time.

Native and browser clients reconnect with bounded backoff and refresh the open
conversation to recover messages missed while disconnected. Outgoing actions use
persisted idempotency keys. A lost response or server restart retains the same
operation identity; retrying that operation does not blindly send another message.
Pending sends remain visible as uncertain until confirmation arrives. A late
WhatsApp acknowledgement reconciles the stored message and operation result.
Check an uncertain conversation before composing a new send. These protections
cannot prove delivery when WhatsApp never returns an acknowledgement.

Keep the backend data volume and client app/browser storage intact for recovery.
Logout clears server recovery records. MCP send claims and outcomes also persist
across backend restarts. Deploy the updated backend before distributing the new
native clients. Network-accessible startup requires a nonblank password; explicit
password-free development binds only to loopback. Password verification allows
15 attempts per minute across the single-user service, including OAuth approval.
