# Arena

## Host compatibility

Follow [pstack host compatibility](../poteto-mode/compatibility.md) throughout this workflow. Use host-native tools and available subagents, inheriting model settings unless the user has explicitly configured supported overrides. A missing independent reviewer is a coverage gap, not a successful review. Work only within the requested scope; external messages, PRs, pushes, merges, deployments, deletion, and schedules require applicable user authorization. Preserve unrelated changes and required legal, safety, and API-contract information.


Open a todolist with one entry per phase (Frame, Fan out, Cross-judge, Pick, Graft, Verify) before launching anything.

## Phase A: Frame

Every candidate gets the same prompt, so the prompt is the contract.

1. State the artifact each candidate is producing.
2. Derive the rubric, 3-6 concrete gradeable criteria for what success looks like on *this* task. It is the picker's tool in Phase D. Candidates only see the task.
3. Pick available host-native runners. Inherit model settings unless the user has explicitly selected supported models. Use independent candidates, and report whether actual model diversity was available.
4. Give each candidate its own output location (a git worktree where possible, otherwise `/tmp/arena-<slug>/candidate-<n>/`), per the **separate-before-serializing-shared-state** principle skill.

## Phase B: Fan out

Launch candidates through host-native delegation, batching within concurrency limits, each with the task, the path to the shared grounding, its own output path, and instructions to produce the artifact and a short rationale naming the alternatives it considered and what it rejected.

If a candidate produces no output, proceed with N-1 and note the dropout.

## Phase C: Cross-judge

After all candidates complete, use an independent read-only judge when delegation is available. It scores the rubric and recommends a base. Prefer a different supported model only when authorized by user preferences. Without an independent judge, perform a separate review pass and explicitly report that independent review was unavailable.

## Phase D: Pick a base

Read every candidate end to end before picking. Score each against the rubric criterion by criterion, not on holistic feel, and compare with the cross-judge. Agreement on the base confirms the pick. Disagreement means one of you is biased or the rubric was ambiguous. Read both rationales before deciding.

Pick the base a future maintainer can extend most easily without breaking invariants. When two feel tied, prefer the cleaner boundary or smaller API, per the Laziness Protocol.

## Phase E: Graft

Walk each losing candidate once more for what is worth porting into the base, usually one or two things per candidate, not most of it. Fold each graft in by hand, per the **redesign-from-first-principles** principle skill, so the result stays coherent under one mental model. Don't paste mechanically.

If the candidates converge on one shape, that is strong agreement. Note it and ship the consensus shape. No graft is needed. If they wildly diverge, Phase A was under-specified. Reframe and re-run rather than averaging the divergence.

## Phase F: Verify

Verify the synthesized artifact like any other output, per the **prove-it-works** principle skill. If verification finds a problem the arena missed, either Phase A was wrong (re-frame and re-run) or a candidate caught it and you missed the graft (go back to Phase E). Don't paper over it.

## Outputs

One synthesized artifact, with a short synthesis note alongside naming the base and why, the cross-judge's verdict, each graft with its source candidate, what was rejected and why, any convergence or dropouts, and the verification result.
